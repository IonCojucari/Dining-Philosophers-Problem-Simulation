# Dining-Philosophers-Problem-Simulation
This project simulates the classic dining philosophers problem using threads and sockets, with a network-based client-server interaction. The objective is to manage philosopher clients accessing shared resources (forks) to eat, while preventing conflicts. This solution incorporates concurrency mechanisms and collects detailed statistics.
